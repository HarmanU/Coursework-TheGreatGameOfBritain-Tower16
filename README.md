# The Great Game of Britain

This is our submission for our Group Project CS module. We were tasked to create a program that simulates a tabletop game, were we picked *"The Great Game of Britain"*, apparently due to all being over the age of 80.

## How It's Made ©

We chose to develop in the Unity game engine, because it's hella powerful. We subsequently realized that we're not all git wiz-kids and collaboration was becoming a chore, so decided to use Unity's in-house *"Collab"* tool, hence the lack of a decent commit history.

Basically we were staring at screens for a few months, and then with the big deadline looming decided to do the work—it even didn't turn out too bad. We all kinda wish we picked something more inspiring though :grimacing:

## The Team

We called oursolves *Tower 16* due to being team #16 in the course, and something to do with towers I forgot.

* Adilya—Project Lead & QA
* Harman—Technical Lead & Developer
* Taris—Developer & UI art
* Matt—Developer
* Sope—Developer & QA
* Jack—Documentation & Blog
* Alex—Developer
* Chantay—Documentation
* Aaron—Dropout

Did roles mean much in the end however...? :wink: :pensive: :hushed:

## TODO

Here's a list to appreciate what more could be added and make us feel bad, but now it's all over with we probably won't touch this again.

* Working action cards.
* Online multiplayer (hotsteat functionality is already there).
* Interactive tutorial.
* Probably need to fix a gazillion bugs.
